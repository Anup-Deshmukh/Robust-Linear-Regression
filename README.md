# Robust-Linear-Regression
 Implementation of two algorithms: 
 -- 1) Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for rank sparsity 
 -- 2) Alternating minimization (AM) for robust regression 
 
The jupyter notbook introduces the problem and the walks you through the code. 
I will soon attach some helpful resources to understand ADMM and AM.
