# Robust-Linear-Regression

Implementation of two algorithms: 
 - Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for rank sparsity 
 - Alternating minimization (AM) for robust regression 
 
This jupyter notbook introduces the problem and then walks you through the code in detail.

Some helpful resources to understand ADMM and AM:
- https://stanford.edu/~boyd/admm.html - Few representative examples of papers and tools  
- https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/course/598/l/n-06-alt.pdf - From a EECS UMICH course

Prerequisites:
```
numpy==1.15.4
tqdm==4.26.0
matplotlib==2.2.3
cv2
glob
scipy
```
